  <h1>A type of disrepair</h1>

  <h2>Types</h2>
  Projects regarding more or less meaningful concepts or proofs in primarily Haskell or Agda.
  <ul>
    <li><a href=https://github.com/samuelhklumpers/agda-extras>agda-extras</a>: a project (re)documenting some common Haskell classes and proving their properties, in Agda
      <ul><li><a href=https://github.com/samuelhklumpers/agda-extras/blob/main/src/Effect/Extra/Applicatives/Solver.agda>The Applicative solver</a></li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>bsp: simplified BSP semantics in Agda, hopefully</li>
    <li>depends: micro Agda in Agda, broken beyond repair, but perhaps an inspirational and cautionary tale (probably attach a version in which you can actually write id)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Misc</h2>
  Miscellaneous small projects and calculations.

  Projects:

    <li><a href=https://github.com/samuelhklumpers/chess3>chess3</a>: a customizable ruleset based boardgame framework (server), including rules for chess, a chaotic chess variant, and shogi, in Python and online (currently not hosted anywhere due to Heroku halting their free plans)</li>
  </ul>

  Scripts:
  <ul>
    <li><a href=misc/pdf_glue_simple.py>pdf_glue_simple</a>: finally a simple tool to glue a pile of images into a pdf (primarily here because I keep losing and rewriting this script)</li>
  </ul>
