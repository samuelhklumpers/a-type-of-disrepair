  <h1>So how much does Peppy earn?</h1>
  <a href=../main.html>Back</a><br><br>

  We make some assumptions, one of which is that Peppy only earns by means of supporters.
  Therefore, we set out to investigate the number of concurrent supporters.

  <br><br>
  We are distrustful of others because:
  <ul>
    <li>they have no reason to tell us the (accurate) truth</li>
    <li>most statements regarding the number of supporters are outdated.</li>
  </ul>

  We find that to give an accurate answer to our question, we must count the supporters directly.
  At the time of writing (2022-10-26), there are ~3.18e7 users.
  On the other hand, the <a href=https://osu.ppy.sh/docs/index.html>osu! api v2</a> has a ratelimit of 1200 requests/minute.
  Scanning all users, without ticking off Peppy, would require ~19 days.
  This stretches our goal far outside the domain of a 'quick question'.
  If we assume that quick questions are answered within a day, we are forced to approximate our answer.

  <br><br>
  Recalling some statistics intuition and sampling bounds, we have that:
  <ul>
    <li>samples of >200 points are more than large enough to have meaningful averages and variances [see 1]</li>
    <li>when we sample a constant fraction of sqrt(N) for a population size N, the confidence interval of the sampled average tends to stay the same for all N  [see 2]</li>
  </ul>
  
  We write up <a href=howmuch/sampling.py>some Python code</a> to perform the sampling for us.
  Clearly, are significant differences in the fractions of supporters in various groups we may identify.
  For example, higher ranking players are more likely to have supporter than lower ranking players [see 3].
  To capture these variations, we bracket our samples by number of digits in the rank of a player, and require that each bracket is sufficiently full.
  (This means, either >200 points, or more points than the square root of the size of the bracket).

  <br><br>
  After sampling for ~2.5 hours, this yields <a href=howmuch/samples.json>a distribution</a>.
  By simple extrapolation, we can estimate the total number of supporters.
  To adjust for the cost of running the servers, we make use of a questionable source, stating that
  paying $26 worth of supporter tags, keeps the servers running for 41.2 minutes.
  Furthermore, we incorporate the bulk discount on supporter tags by using that lowest price a supporter tag can be is $2.166/month,
  and the highest it can be is $4/month.

  The script then outputs the following overview:

<pre><code>
sampled 77    /  99        from 0         until 100      , extrapolating to 77     (77.78%)
sampled 531   /  901       from 100       until 1000     , extrapolating to 530    (58.93%)
sampled 3393  /  9000      from 1000      until 10000    , extrapolating to 3393   (37.70%)
sampled 81    /  409       from 10000     until 100000   , extrapolating to 17823  (19.80%)
sampled 86    /  4257      from 100000    until 1000000  , extrapolating to 18181  (2.02%)
sampled 16    /  11609     from 1000000   until 10000000 , extrapolating to 12404  (0.14%)
sampled 20    /  123742    from 10000000  until 31797108 , extrapolating to 3522   (0.02%)
total extrapolated supporters 55930
monthly acquired moneys between lies between 121144 and 223720
yearly acquired moneys lies between 1453733 and 2684640

peppy loses 331689 moneys per year
this leaves between 1122044 and 2352951 per year

this number of supporters yields between 2303607 and 4254122 minutes per year
or between 4.38 and 8.09 years per year
</code></pre>

  This tells us, among other facts, that Peppy earns between $1.12e6 and $2.35e6 per year.

  Under conditions which we will postulate without further justification,
  the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem>Central limit theorem</a> states that the sample average, considered as a random variable itself, of
  independently drawn samples, that is i.i.d. random variables, from _any_ distribution (satisfying these conditions) will be distributed normally for sufficient n.
  The rate of convergence then does depend on the specific distribution, but not on the population size, hence >100 is a generally accepted lower bound on sufficient n.

  The reason for this may be twofold: these higher ranking players are typically both more invested in osu!, hence may be more willing to spend on the game,
  while they also gather more attention, and are more likely to be gifted supporter tags from fans or otherwise.
  Whatever the reason, for our purposes the end result is the same: the number of supporters at the start of a month remains
  a lower bound on the units of supporter paid for the previous month [see 4].

  Certain usergroups are awarded supporter for the role they fulfill, however, we immediately assume that their influence is neglegible.
